# Prediction-for-Mortality-Rate-of-Lung-Cancer
This project is guided by professor Samin Aref.

The goal of this project was to develop a statistical model to predict the mortality rate of lung cancer in the United States. To achieve this, we utilized Python's NumPy and Pandas libraries for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset. The dataset was carefully examined and relevant features were selected for use in the supervised learning models. Multiple regression models were implemented using the statsmodels package, and a Random Forest model was also built using the sklearn package.

The Random Forest model that was built achieved an impressive accuracy of 93% in predicting the mortality rate of lung cancer in the United States.
